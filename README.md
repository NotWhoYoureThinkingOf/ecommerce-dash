This project is to test out making an Ecommerce page with an admin dashboard where things can be changed

- React
- Redux
- Firebase (for at least authorization, maybe more)
- Framer Motion
- Material UI

Potentially:

- GraphQL
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB

Goals:

<!-- Start with firebase to get it working and then think about converting to MERN -->

- Authorization with Firebase
- Add/Remove items from cart
- Make data.js with array of items (collection on mongoDB or Firebase)
- Make item sticky on product page
- Responsive
- Utilize animations (maybe parallax)
- Allow someone to add/remove/edit data. js on a backend. Use dashboard.png and dashboard2.PNG for design
- Use GraphQL to get information from an API
- Make full stack with Express and MongoDB

Notes

AllProducts.js:

- move firebase api call from AllProducts to MainPage and add to redux from there so products can be accessed right away

Info.js:

- main-products-highlight.mp4: idea for products shown on main page maybe

App.js:

- try to incorporate something from after effects using the youtube tutorials (FLIMLION channel)

Products.js:

- add a page for keyboards
- add a page for mice
- change the pictures/details headsets page to call in selected item stuff
