This project is to test out making an Ecommerce page with an admin dashboard where things can be changed

- React
- Redux
- Firebase (for at least authorization, maybe more)
- Framer Motion
- Material UI

Potentially:

- GraphQL
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB

Goals:

<!-- Start with firebase to get it working and then think about converting to MERN -->

- Authorization with Firebase
- Add/Remove items from cart
- Make data.js with array of items (collection on mongoDB or Firebase)
- Make item sticky on product page
- Responsive
- Utilize animations (maybe parallax)
- Allow someone to add/remove/edit data. js on a backend. Use dashboard.png and dashboard2.PNG for design
- Use GraphQL to get information from an API
- Make full stack with Express and MongoDB

- Add links to seperate products from AllProducts and select which kind of product from there
